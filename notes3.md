JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension used in React that allows developers to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript. It is a key feature in React and offers a more concise and readable way to describe the structure of React components.

Here are some key points about JSX:

1. **HTML-Like Syntax:** JSX looks similar to HTML but gets compiled to plain JavaScript. For example:
   ```jsx
   const element = <h1>Hello, JSX!</h1>;
   ```
   This JSX code can be rendered into a React element.

2. **Embedding JavaScript Expressions:** JSX allows embedding JavaScript expressions within curly braces `{}`. For example:
   ```jsx
   const name = "World";
   const element = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
   ```
   Here, the `{name}` expression is evaluated as a JavaScript variable.

3. **Components in JSX:** You can use JSX to create React components. For instance:
   ```jsx
   function Greeting(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
   }

   const element = <Greeting name="World" />;
   ```
   The `<Greeting />` syntax represents a custom React component.

4. **Attributes in JSX:** You can pass HTML attributes to JSX elements like you would in HTML:
   ```jsx
   const element = <img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="Example" />;
   ```
   In React, these attributes are known as props and can be accessed within components.

5. **Preventing Injection Attacks:** JSX automatically escapes any values embedded in it, preventing the injection of malicious code. This helps in avoiding potential security vulnerabilities.

6. **Not Mandatory:** JSX is not mandatory to use with React, but it greatly simplifies writing React components by providing a more declarative and expressive syntax.

JSX is transformed into regular JavaScript using a transpiler like Babel before it's executed in the browser. This transformation turns JSX syntax into JavaScript function calls that create React elements, making it understandable for the browser.

Overall, JSX in React provides a more natural and readable way to write UI components, making the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
